= Versioned Fields

== TODO list for version `0.1.0`:

- Create declarative syntax (DSL?) for describing migrations
- Support for `ActiveRecord` for starters
- For column `foo` check if `foo_version` is present in the corresponding table

Future TODO:

1. Support for Sequel
2. Support for DataMapper

== Usage

Having table `users` with field `address`, and `address_version`.

On version 1 we have addresses like `Green Avenue, #1516`
On version 2 we want to append city to it: `Los Angeles, Green Avenue, #1516`
On version 3 we want to replace city with state: `LA, Green Avenue #1516`

# db/versioned_fields/foo.rb

VersionedFields::Migration.draw_for(User, :foo) do
  version 1 # automatically set smallest version as initial one
  version 2 do |value|
    "Los Angeles #{value}"
  end

  version 3 do |value|
    value.gsub('Los Angeles', 'LA')
  end
end
